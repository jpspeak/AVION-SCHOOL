              American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts

      <h4 class="mt-4">Action Hero</h4>
      <p>
        Lee gained a measure of celebrity with his role in the television series
        The Green Hornet, which aired in 26 episodes from 1966 to '67. In the
        show, which was based on a 1930s radio program, the wiry Lee displayed
        his acrobatic and theatrical fighting style as the Hornet's sidekick,
        Kato. He went on to make guest appearances in such TV shows as Ironside
        and Longstreet, while a notable film role came in 1969's Marlowe,
        starring James Garner as the notable detective created by Raymond
        Chandler. (The screenwriter for the film, Stirling Silliphant, was one
        of Lee's martial arts students. Other Lee students included James
        Coburn, Steve McQueen and Garner himself.)

      <h4>Mysterious Death</h4>
      <p>
        On July 20, 1973, just one month before the premiere of Enter the
        Dragon, Lee died in Hong Kong, China, at the age of 32. The official
        cause of his sudden and utterly unexpected death was a brain edema,
        found in an autopsy to have been caused by a strange reaction to a
        prescription painkiller he was reportedly taking for a back injury.
        Controversy surrounded Lee's death from the beginning, as some claimed
        he had been murdered. There was also the belief that he might have been
        cursed, a conclusion driven by Lee's obsession with his own early death.
