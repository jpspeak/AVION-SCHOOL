      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Action Hero</h4>
      <p>
        Lee gained a measure of celebrity with his role in the television series
        The Green Hornet, which aired in 26 episodes from 1966 to '67. In the
        show, which was based on a 1930s radio program, the wiry Lee displayed
        his acrobatic and theatrical fighting style as the Hornet's sidekick,
        Kato. He went on to make guest appearances in such TV shows as Ironside
        and Longstreet, while a notable film role came in 1969's Marlowe,
        starring James Garner as the notable detective created by Raymond
        Chandler. (The screenwriter for the film, Stirling Silliphant, was one
        of Lee's martial arts students. Other Lee students included James
        Coburn, Steve McQueen and Garner himself.)
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Philosophy</h4>
      <p>
        While best known as a martial artist, Lee also studied drama and Asian
        and Western philosophy starting while a student at the University of
        Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by
        martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His own books on martial
        arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical
        assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His
        eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was
        quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such
        teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to
        self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was
        martial arts. His influences include Taoism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and
        Buddhism. Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the
        conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states
        that Lee was an atheist. When asked in 1972 about his religious
        affiliation, he replied, "none whatsoever", and when asked if he
        believed in God, he said, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not."
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Mysterious Death</h4>
      <p>
        On July 20, 1973, just one month before the premiere of Enter the
        Dragon, Lee died in Hong Kong, China, at the age of 32. The official
        cause of his sudden and utterly unexpected death was a brain edema,
        found in an autopsy to have been caused by a strange reaction to a
        prescription painkiller he was reportedly taking for a back injury.
        Controversy surrounded Lee's death from the beginning, as some claimed
        he had been murdered. There was also the belief that he might have been
        cursed, a conclusion driven by Lee's obsession with his own early death.
